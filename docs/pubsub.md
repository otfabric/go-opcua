# PubSub (Part 14)

OPC UA PubSub sends data from publishers to any number of subscribers without
sessions: a publisher samples a *DataSet* at a fixed interval and sends it as a
*NetworkMessage* over UDP or through an MQTT broker, and subscribers pick the
DataSets they are interested in from what arrives. go-opcua implements both
sides, standalone (no OPC UA server needed) and inside the server, where
published fields come from the address space and received fields are written
to variables.

| Area | Supported |
|------|-----------|
| Message mappings | UADP (binary) and JSON (`ua-data`, `ua-metadata`, `ua-status`) |
| Transports | UDP unicast and multicast (`opc.udp://`), MQTT 3.1.1 (`mqtt://`, `mqtts://`) with UADP or JSON |
| UADP field encodings | Variant, DataValue, RawData |
| DataSetMessages | key frames, delta frames, keep-alive, events (PublishedEvents) |
| Message security | Sign and SignAndEncrypt with PubSub-Aes128-CTR and PubSub-Aes256-CTR (UADP) |
| Keys | static keys, Security Key Service (SKS) server, SKS pull client, SetSecurityKeys push |
| Configuration | the standard `ua.PubSubConfigurationDataType`, builders for common setups, runtime add / remove / enable / disable |
| Information model | `Server/PublishSubscribe` with connections, groups, writers, readers, published data sets, status and the configuration methods |
| Diagnostics | Part 14 §9.1.11 diagnostics objects on PublishSubscribe and every connection, group, writer and reader (`pubsub.Diagnostics`, Reset, DiagnosticsLevel) |
| Remote configuration | package `pubsub/remote` calls the PubSub methods of any Part 14 server |
| Not implemented | Ethernet (`opc.eth://`), AMQP, chunked NetworkMessages, UADP discovery requests, PubSub actions |

Interoperability is tested against open62541 v1.5.9 (see the interop ledger,
profile `pubsub`), the only peer with PubSub in the interop suite: Eclipse Milo
1.1.8 and async-opcua 0.19 have no PubSub implementation, PubSub is a commercial
add-on for node-opcua, and UA-.NETStandard 2.0.1 ships a PubSub runtime that its
opcua-interop adapter does not drive (not tested).

## Packages

| Package | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| `pubsub` | runtime: publishers, subscribers, state machine, builders |
| `pubsub/message` | encoding-independent NetworkMessage / DataSetMessage model |
| `pubsub/uadp` | UADP message mapping incl. message security |
| `pubsub/jsonmsg` | JSON message mapping |
| `pubsub/transport`, `/udp`, `/mqtt` | transport registry and the UDP and MQTT transports |
| `pubsub/security` | security policies, key rings, the key service (SKS logic) |
| `pubsub/sks` | SKS client: GetSecurityKeys, SetSecurityKeys, a key source that pulls and refreshes |
| `pubsub/remote` | client helpers for the PublishSubscribe methods of a server |

The configuration model is the generated one in package `ua`
(`PubSubConfigurationDataType`, `WriterGroupDataType`,
`UADPWriterGroupMessageDataType`, `DataSetMetaDataType`, the content masks,
...). There is no second type system: a configuration built with go-opcua can
be sent to another server with `AddConnection`, and one read from another
stack can be loaded with `pubsub.New`.

## Publish without a server

```go
values := pubsub.NewMemoryDataSource()
counter := ua.NewStringNodeID(1, "counter")

pds := pubsub.PublishedDataItems("Measurements",
    pubsub.Var("Counter", counter, ua.TypeIDUint32))
group := pubsub.WriterGroup("Group", 100, 100*time.Millisecond,
    pubsub.DataSetWriter("Writer", 1, "Measurements"))
cfg := pubsub.NewConfiguration([]*ua.PublishedDataSetDataType{pds},
    pubsub.AttachWriterGroups(
        pubsub.UDPConnection("UDP", "opc.udp://224.0.0.22:4840", uint16(2234)), group))

ps, err := pubsub.New(cfg, pubsub.WithDataSource(values))
if err != nil { ... }
if err := ps.Start(ctx); err != nil { ... }
defer ps.Close()

_ = values.Set(counter, uint32(42)) // published with the next interval
```

`DataSource` is an interface; implement it to publish values from anywhere.
`KeyFrameCount` on the writer sends delta frames between key frames,
`KeepAliveTime` on the group sends keep-alive messages when nothing changes.

## Subscribe without a server

UADP carries no field names and, with RawData, no types, so a reader needs the
DataSetMetaData of the writer:

```go
md := pubsub.MetaData("Measurements",
    pubsub.Field{Name: "Counter", Type: ua.TypeIDUint32})
reader := pubsub.DataSetReader("Reader", uint16(2234), 100, 1, md)
reader.MessageReceiveTimeout = 1000 // ms: the reader goes to Error without messages

cfg := pubsub.NewConfiguration(nil,
    pubsub.AttachReaderGroups(
        pubsub.UDPConnection("UDP", "opc.udp://224.0.0.22:4840", nil),
        pubsub.ReaderGroup("Group", reader)))

ps, err := pubsub.New(cfg, pubsub.WithDataSetHandler(func(ds *pubsub.ReceivedDataSet) {
    log.Printf("#%d Counter=%v", ds.SequenceNumber, ds.Field("Counter").Value)
}))
```

The reader filters on PublisherId, WriterGroupId and DataSetWriterId, discards
duplicate and stale messages by sequence number, merges delta frames onto the
last key frame (`ReceivedDataSet.Fields` always holds every field, `Changed`
lists the ones the message carried) and drops messages with a different
MajorVersion. With the JSON mapping the field names travel in the message and
the metadata can also arrive as a `ua-metadata` message on the broker.

## MQTT and JSON

```go
conn := pubsub.MQTTConnection("Broker", "mqtt://broker:1883", "urn:my:publisher", pubsub.MappingJSON)
group := pubsub.JSONWriterGroup("Group", 1, time.Second, "plant/line1",
    pubsub.DataSetWriter("Writer", 1, "Measurements"))
```

`MQTTConnection(..., pubsub.MappingUADP)` sends UADP over the broker instead.
Topics are the `QueueName` of the writer (or group) and of the reader;
`SetWriterQueue` / `SetReaderQueue` also set the metadata queue, on which the
publisher sends retained `ua-metadata` messages. `WithTransportConfig` sets
broker credentials and TLS (`mqtts://`).

## In the server

`server.WithPubSub(cfg, opts...)` runs a PubSub runtime inside the server:

- `PublishedDataItems` read the variables of the address space (AttributeId,
  IndexRange, SubstituteValue for Bad values),
- `PublishedEvents` publish the events the server emits,
- readers with `TargetVariables` write the received fields to variables
  (WriteIndexRange, OverrideValueHandling), and `SubscribedDataSetMirror`
  creates variables for them,
- the configuration appears below `Objects/Server/PublishSubscribe`, and
  clients can change it with AddConnection, AddWriterGroup,
  AddPublishedDataItems, AddDataSetWriter, AddReaderGroup, AddDataSetReader,
  the Remove methods and Enable / Disable on every Status object.
  `server.WithPubSubAuthorizer` decides who may call them (default: everyone,
  as open62541).

`(*Server).PubSub()` returns the runtime; `PubSubNodeID` and
`PubSubComponentID` map between components and their nodes. See
`examples/pubsub/server`.

## Diagnostics

`(*PubSub).Diagnostics(id)` returns the diagnostics object of a component (Part
14 §9.1.11): the counters with their value, `Active`, `Classification`,
`DiagnosticsLevel` and `TimeFirstChange`, `TotalInformation`, `TotalError`,
`SubError` and the LiveValues. `ResetDiagnostics(id)` is the Reset method,
`SetDiagnosticsLevel(id, level)` and `pubsub.WithDiagnosticsLevel` set the
level (default Basic). In a server they appear as the `Diagnostics` object of
`PublishSubscribe` (i=17409, PubSubDiagnosticsRootType) and of every
connection, group, writer and reader, added and removed with them. The
DiagnosticsLevel is read-only in the address space.

| Object | Counters (besides the state counters) | LiveValues |
|--------|----------------------------------------|------------|
| PublishSubscribe | | Configured / Operational DataSetWriters and DataSetReaders |
| Connection | | ResolvedAddress |
| WriterGroup | SentNetworkMessages, FailedTransmissions, EncryptionErrors (Advanced) | Configured / Operational DataSetWriters, SecurityTokenID, TimeToNextTokenID (Info) |
| ReaderGroup | ReceivedNetworkMessages, ReceivedInvalidNetworkMessages (Advanced), DecryptionErrors (Advanced) | Configured / Operational DataSetReaders |
| DataSetWriter | FailedDataSetMessages | MessageSequenceNumber, StatusCode, MajorVersion, MinorVersion (Info) |
| DataSetReader | FailedDataSetMessages, DecryptionErrors (Advanced) | MessageSequenceNumber, StatusCode, MajorVersion, MinorVersion, SecurityTokenID, TimeToNextTokenID (Info) |

Every object counts its state transitions by cause: StateError,
StateOperationalByMethod / ByParent / FromError, StatePausedByParent and
StateDisabledByMethod (Start and the end of the runtime count as caused by
the parent of PublishSubscribe). Counters and LiveValues above the
DiagnosticsLevel of their object do not count and read Bad_OutOfService; a
counter starts again at 0 when it becomes active. A NetworkMessage that cannot
be decoded counts for the reader groups whose readers its header matched (all
of the connection when the header itself is broken): as DecryptionErrors when
the message security failed (also for the secured readers), else as
ReceivedInvalidNetworkMessages. The `Counters` of `Status` stay cumulative and
are not reset.

## Configure a remote server

```go
r := remote.New(client)
connID, err := r.AddConnection(ctx, pubsub.UDPConnection("UDP", "opc.udp://224.0.0.22:4840", uint16(7)))
pds, err := r.AddPublishedDataItems(ctx, "DataSet", aliases, flags, variables) // DataSet node, version, per-field results
wgID, err := r.AddWriterGroup(ctx, connID, pubsub.WriterGroup("Group", 1, time.Second))
_, err = r.AddDataSetWriter(ctx, wgID, pubsub.DataSetWriter("Writer", 1, "DataSet"))
err = r.Enable(ctx, connID)
```

The helpers find the methods by browse name and work with go-opcua and
open62541 servers.

## Security

A secured group has a `SecurityMode` (Sign or SignAndEncrypt) and a
`SecurityGroupId` (`pubsub.Secure(group, mode, id)`); the runtime takes the keys
of that SecurityGroup from a `security.KeySource`:

| Source | Use |
|--------|-----|
| `security.NewKeyRing(id, policy)` + `SetKeys` | static keys, or keys pushed with SetSecurityKeys |
| `security.KeyService.KeySource(id)` | the SKS runs in the same process |
| `sks.NewKeySource(ctx, sks.Config{...})` | pull keys from a remote SKS and refresh them before they rotate |

Pass it with `pubsub.WithKeySource(id, ks)` or `pubsub.WithKeySourceLookup`.
A secured writer group sends nothing until it has keys; a reader requires at
least the security mode of its group and rejects messages with unknown tokens,
bad signatures or weaker security.

A go-opcua server becomes a Security Key Service with
`srv.EnableSecurityKeyService(ks)` (GetSecurityKeys, Add/Remove/GetSecurityGroup;
keys are only handed out over SignAndEncrypt channels and, by default, not to
anonymous users) and accepts pushed keys with `srv.EnableSecurityKeyPush`.

## Interoperating with open62541

- UADP PublisherIds are matched with the same integer width: configure the
  same type (e.g. UInt16) on both sides.
- open62541 1.5.9's JSON subscriber accepts only key frames and sequence
  numbers up to 65535 (go-opcua wraps JSON sequence numbers at 16 bits).
- open62541's MQTT client uses QoS 0, no TLS, and messages must stay small
  (about 1000 bytes).
- open62541 publishes delta frames even with KeyFrameCount 1 and discards
  them as a subscriber; it has no events, chunking or discovery messages.
- Its GetSecurityKeys returns a wrong (negative) TimeToNextKey; go-opcua's
  key rings treat a non-positive TimeToNextKey as KeyLifetime.
